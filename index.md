## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi! My name is Kaila, and I am a current Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I have a deep passion for physics, design, robotics, aerospace, and automotive engineering. I am an active member of Combat Robotics @ Cornell, one of Cornell's leading project teams, and I am passionate about close collaboration and making engineering fun.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, and talking about movies. This is my third year volunteering for Guiding Eyes for the Blind, where I train future service dogs. I love being outdoors and exploring nature, and I take every opportunity to try new things and meet new people. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
